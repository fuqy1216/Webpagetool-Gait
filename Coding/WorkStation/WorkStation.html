  <table>

  <tr><td width="640">All work objects -- controls, tools and parts -- should be located within easy reach of the worker.  It was Henry Ford who said:
  <ul><i>The work must be brought to the man; not the man to the work. The work must be brought to the man waist-high.  No worker must ever have to stoop to attach a wheel, bolt, screw, or anything else to the moving chassis.</i>
    <br><ul>Burlingame R: Henry Ford: A Great Life in Brief, p. 75, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1966.</ul></ul>
  <p>Yet it is still common to find work objects located such that workers must bend or stretch to the limits of their their capacity to reach for, grasp or use them.<b>
  <tr><td width="640">This page provides some basic information that can be used to determine size ranges for female and male workers, their relative proportions and their abilities to reach objects on a bench surface.
